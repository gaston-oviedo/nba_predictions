# NBA Predictions

## Introduction

In this project, an analysis of the NBA Players data is carried out. In addition, some prediction are made about the salaries and classification of the players. 

In the notebook file, the following sections can be found:

## Data Exploration

In this section an analysis is made between the salary of the players and the different performance of the game.

## Salary Prediction

In this section, player salaries are mostly forecast using a very rudimentary baseline. After that, an SGDRegressor with a single variable is used. Then an SGDRegressor with multivariate is used. Finally, a decision tree is used to predict player salaries.

## All-NBA Classification

In this section a Classification is made if the player is in All-NBA or not. A LogisticRegression is used as the baseline. After that, a custom classifier is used.

## Handmade Linear Regressor

In this section, a linear regressor class is created from scratch. Then, a comparison is made between this model and those used previously.
